### Purpose

The two tutorials in this pre-lab will familiarize you with the concepts of model organisms, with an emphasis on *Drosophila*. This information will help you look up information about *Drosophila* genes and find human orthologs to *Drosophila* genes.


### Learning Objectives

1. Explain the importance of model organisms and identify some of their desirable characteristics. 
1. Describe the usefulness of Drosophila as a model system.

### Introduction

Scientists frequently use a few specific organisms, called “model organisms” for their experiments. This tutorial will introduce you to a few of the most popular model organisms and will discuss why these organisms were chosen and what they are useful for.

The fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*) is a popular model organism used to study a wide range of biological questions. The second tutorial will introduce you to some of the types of research being conducted with fruit flies, give a brief overview of *Drosophila biology*, and show you what it’s like to work with *Drosophila* in the lab.

## Lab Activity: Biological Databases

### Purpose

In this activity, students  will learn to search the same online databases used by scientists to collect information about a set of genes and present them to your group. This will give you an opportunity to engage in inquiry-based learning and apply the concepts in molecular biology and genetics from this course.

### Learning Objectives

1. Use online databases to look up information about a gene.

### Activity 1 - Databases

Estimated time: 15 min

#### Instructions

1. Follow [these directions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nQ-wd4hX0Xtd4mfloXcpbbtK_CqDzY874oqmBYql1M8){target="_blank"} to launch your first LearnR tutorial: Biological Databases Tutorial.
1. To move through the activities click "Continue" at the bottom of the screen. When you are done with a topic, click "Next Topic" to move on.
1. As you complete the tutorial, fill in the table below. This will help you know which database to go back to later on.

#### Questions
