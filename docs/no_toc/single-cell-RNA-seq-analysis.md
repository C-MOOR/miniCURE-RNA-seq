# Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis

## Background: Single-cell RNA sequencing

### Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to introduce single-cell RNA sequencing, how it works, and how it is different from bulk RNA sequencing.

### Learning Objectives

1. Compare and contrast single-cell and bulk RNA-seq
1. Explain what a UMAP plot is and why it is useful for single-cell RNA-seq

### Introduction

While bulk RNA sequencing allows us to examine gene expression in a tissue as a whole, newer technologies enable us to look at gene expression in individual cells, opening up new avenues for scientific research. This tutorial will explain the basics of single-cell RNA sequencing and discuss how it compares to bulk RNA-seq. It will also introduce you to UMAP plots - a common method for exploring single-cell sequencing data.

## Lab Activity: Single-Cell RNA-seq

### Purpose

This lab will teach students how to explore single-cell RNA-seq data.  This will enable them to use scRNA-seq data to investigate their scientific questions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Launch cellxgene on SciServer.
1. Use cellxgene to determine which cell types express a gene.
1. Compare expression of different genes across cell types.

### Introduction

In this lab, students will explore single-cell RNA-seq data from the *Drosophila* gut, using data from the Fly Cell Atlas.  The Fly Cell Atlas is a large collection of single-cell sequencing data from *Drosophila* (fruit flies), with the goal of creating a map of all the cell types in a fruit fly.  Many scientists have contributed to the Fly Cell Atlas, and it is an incredible resource for anybody working with fruit flies.  

Analyzing single-cell sequencing data is difficult, because there is just so much data!  The **cellxgene** (pronounced “cell-by-gene”) tool provides an interactive visualization of the data, giving investigators a big-picture overview of the data and also enabling them to select specific cell types or genes for further investigation.  The Fly Cell Atlas has made cellxgene available on its website ([flycellatlas.org](https://flycellatlas.org/)), but for this lab we will use cellxgene on SciServer as it offers more functionality (e.g. ability to identify differentially expressed genes).  Learning how to use cellxgene will give students a valuable tool for investigating scientific questions.

"Gene markers" are genes that are expressed in one cell type and not in any others.  We call them "markers" because we can use them to tell cell types apart.

| Looking at the UMAP plots above, which gene (dpy or ect) is a better gene marker for the adult pylorus cells? |
