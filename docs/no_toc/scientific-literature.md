### Purpose

We've all heard the saying. The best way to learn is by doing. So, let's jump right in and read a science paper! As you read through the paper, keep in mind that you are not expected to understand everything the first time through. We will go through the paper in detail in the lab. Complete and upload the assignment.

## Lab Activity: Scientific Literature

### Instructions

Follow your instructor’s instructions  and answer the following questions with your group. In your responses, properly paraphrase (do not copy/paste or inappropriately paraphrase).  To receive credit, you must use your own words and sentence structure.  Using the same sentence structure (and changing a few words only) is considered plagiarism.
