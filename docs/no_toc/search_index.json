The job of a Data Scientist was called by the Harvard Business Review “the sexiest job of the 21st century” Data Scientists are individuals with a curiosity to look through data, identify patterns and develop testable hypotheses. In Biological Sciences, data scientists dig through data to answer questions about health, disease, evolution, ecology, drug development, and much more. A currently relevant example is compiling and looking at the similarities and differences between the different SARS-CoV-2 strains and identify differences between strains that may lead to differences in rates of infection. 1.1.2 What is C-MOOR? C-MOOR is a project to invite students to join the data science revolution and be part of the next generation of data scientists.

You can follow along with the video, or follow the steps below. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute” Click “Create container” Give your container a name. This can be anything you like, but it’s useful if it says something about the purpose of the container so you can tell your containers apart. You could name this container “Tutorials”, since you’ll be using it to access tutorials. In the “Compute Image” drop-down menu, select “C-MOOR LearnR” Under “Data Volumes”, check the box next to “C-MOOR Data” Click “Create”. This may take a moment. You should now see a new entry in your list of containers “Created At” should be a few moments ago. “Name” should be the name you chose “Image” should be “C-MOOR LearnR” Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name (whatever name you chose when you created it). This will open in a new tab. You should see a list of tutorials, organized by topic. If instead you see an error message, you most likely forgot to check the box next to “C-MOOR Data” when you created the container. If you see something else, you may have picked the wrong “Compute Image” from the drop-down menu. If anything goes wrong, you can always delete your container by clicking the red “X” in the last column, and create a new container. 1.4.4.2.1 Resources sciserver.org Get help with SciServer on the C-MOOR Discourse 1.4.4.3 Complete your first LearnR tutorial If you’re not there already, go to the SciServer compute page and start up the C-MOOR LearnR container. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute”. Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name. Click on “Biological Databases”. The tutorial will open in a new tab.

In the following lab, we will use these skills to compare two RNA-seq data sets to investigate gene expression patterns. 4.3.2 Learning Objectives Use R to analyze HTSeq files Create and analyze histograms from HTSeq files 4.3.3 Introduction Today’s lab will investigate how scientists use computer science to analyze RNA-seq data. In general, the sequences are first aligned to a reference genome. For RNA-seq, the sequences will align to exons of the expressed genes. The data you will look at today has already been processed using a program called HTSeq. This program aligns the sequences to the reference genome and counts how many sequences align to each gene, producing files known as HTSeq files. The more sequences that align to the gene, the higher the expression level of the gene. The following tutorial will walk you through how to analyze an HTSeq file using the programming language R. The RNA-seq libraries from today’s lab are from: eLife 2013;2:e00886 DOI: 10.7554/eLife.00886.

This will enable them to use scRNA-seq data to investigate their scientific questions. 6.2.2 Learning Objectives Launch cellxgene on SciServer. Use cellxgene to determine which cell types express a gene. Compare expression of different genes across cell types. 6.2.3 Introduction In this lab, students will explore single-cell RNA-seq data from the Drosophila gut, using data from the Fly Cell Atlas. The Fly Cell Atlas is a large collection of single-cell sequencing data from Drosophila (fruit flies), with the goal of creating a map of all the cell types in a fruit fly. Many scientists have contributed to the Fly Cell Atlas, and it is an incredible resource for anybody working with fruit flies. Analyzing single-cell sequencing data is difficult, because there is just so much data! The cellxgene (pronounced “cell-by-gene”) tool provides an interactive visualization of the data, giving investigators a big-picture overview of the data and also enabling them to select specific cell types or genes for further investigation. The Fly Cell Atlas has made cellxgene available on its website (flycellatlas.org), but for this lab we will use cellxgene on SciServer as it offers more functionality (e.g. ability to identify differentially expressed genes). Learning how to use cellxgene will give students a valuable tool for investigating scientific questions. Watch this video (video)(slides) to learn more about Fly Cell Atlas and cellxgene. 6.2.4 Activity 1 - Launch cellxgene on SciServer Estimated time: 15 min 6.2.4.1 Instructions Log into SciServer. Follow the instructions in this video (video)(slides) to launch cellxgene on SciServer with the Drosophila gut data. Look at the data on SciServer and answer the question below. 6.2.4.2 Questions How many cell types are annotated in the Drosophila gut dataset? 6.2.5 Activity 2 - Explore genes of interest identified by differential expression analyses Estimated time: 15 min 6.2.5.1 Instructions Launch cellxgene on SciServer. Follow the instructions in this video (video) (slides) to learn how to explore the expression of genes of interest Set cellxgene to show the expression of the gene Cht8, and answer the question below. (You can refer back to the video for how to view expression of a specific gene.) 6.2.5.2 Questions In which of the following cell types is the gene Cht8 expressed the most? A) Crop B) Cardia C) Posterior midgut D) Anterior midgut 6.2.6 Activity 3 - Differential expression and gene marker identification Estimated time: 15 min 6.2.6.1 Instructions Launch cellxgene on SciServer. Follow the instructions in this video (video) (slides) to learn how to perform differential gene expression and explore genes of interest using cellxgene. 6.2.6.2 Questions “Gene markers” are genes that are expressed in one cell type and not in any others. We call them “markers” because we can use them to tell cell types apart. Looking at the UMAP plots above, which gene (dpy or ect) is a better gene marker for the adult pylorus cells? Explain your answer to the previous question. 6.2.7 Footnotes 6.2.7.1 Resources Google Doc 6.2.7.2 Contributions and Affiliations Javier Carpinteyro-Ponce Ph.D., Carnegie Institution for Science Katherine Cox, Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University Matthew McCoy, Ph.D., Stanford University Frederick Tan, Ph.D., Carnegie Institution for Science Last Revised: October 2023 "],["kickstart-project-work.html", "Chapter 7 Kickstart Project Work", " Chapter 7 Kickstart Project Work Purpose The purpose of this lab is to gain practice in scientific communication, project exploration and work on your scientific poster! Learning Objectives Engage with the Scientific Process Communicate your findings Create an outline for further exploratory research Develop your plot images using R code Introduction In today’s lab we will learn to develop a scientific idea and convert it into a scientific hypothesis. Remember that a hypothesis needs to be testable and falsifiable. Since your project is in silico, your experiments will be in silico. You might look at a gene, do some background research on that gene, wonder about the gene function and its relationship to gene expression. Then use this information to develop a hypothesis about its expression and test your hypothesis by analyzing gene expression. The most difficult part of your research will be identifying a gene that is differentially expressed and interesting enough to build a narrative around it. A few ideas to get you started: Research a disease – For example: Look up genes involved in digestive diseases at NIDDK or GARD Research a gene or gene family – For example: Trypsin, how many different trypsins are in flies? Research a gene pathway – For example: How many other genes work with trypsin to digest protein? Another interesting area may be due to other absorption problems in the gut besides glucose, like issues in lipid or protein metabolism. We read a paper about how flies can be used as a model for diabetes, could it be used as a model for other diseases? Use data to support your conclusions. This is just scratching the surface of the types of projects that can be developed or begun with the information you now have at your fingertips. All good research begins with an observation or question but the best ones have to do with the follow up research. Instructions 7.0.1 Activity 1 - Search for an interesting differentially expressed gene Estimated time: 45 min (this is at a minimum to find an interesting gene to pursue) Log into SciServer, click on compute and open your “C-MOOR LearnR” container. Start the “Differential Gene Expression” tutorial. Visit SciServer Guides and FAQs. if you need to jog your memory on how to do this. This tutorial has small boxes in which you can enter and run short lines of code to analyze the data. Since we are not working directly in RStudio but in a LearnR tutorial environment, you don’t need to know more than a few lines of code to be able to ask some very interesting questions. Use the Notes section below to copy and paste important blocks of code that you can refer back to later. We will go through an example and you can use this to get other ideas for your project. 7.0.1.1 Questions Here is an example and therefore this is not available for your project as we want different projects. Look up the gene trypsin. How many trypsin genes are in drosophila? What are their FBgn IDs? Use the code to find the expression of trypsin across all regions. What can you conclude? What do you think it suggests about the function of the genes and the regions? Compare the expression between the two highest regions. Record your observations and write two short paragraphs. I was surprised by … I’m curious about … Notes 7.0.2 Activity 2 - Explore your gene further Estimated time: 45 min Work with a partner to complete the following analysis using the Try it Out section of the tutorial. 7.0.2.1 Questions Graph your gene of interest across all the regions of the gut INSERT YOUR GRAPH Create a clusterProfiler graph comparing two regions. If the number of pathways are too many, increase the stringency of your adjusted p-value to reduce the clusters. Pick a cluster to explore, copy and paste the image and write a description of what the image shows. Compare two regions for your gene of interest. What does this suggest? INSERT YOUR GRAPH Look up possible genes that might work with your gene of interest. Hint: what is in the clusterProfiler you performed? 7.0.3 Activity 3 - Begin developing your poster! Estimated time: 30 min Turn in at least one graph that you can use in your poster and include a legend for your figure. Your legend should describe in prose what the figure is showing. Post your tentative title and project idea on the class padlet, include the names of everyone in your group.

This might be in the form of a peer-reviewed journal article or a more informal poster presentation at a conference or symposium. In this assignment, students will work with their groups to put together their work from the C-MOOR Labs into a Digital Poster. 9.1.2 Part 1 - Choose a Template Read through the grading criteria at the end of this document. With your group, choose a template to use for your poster. You can use one of the ones provided below or another one you find on the internet. Just make sure it has a space for an abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, references and acknowledgments. Discuss with your group how you will divide up the work and exchange important information (e.g. phone numbers, email). 9.1.3 Part 2 - Make an Academic Research Poster Complete the following components of your research poster with your group. You might not do them in this order, but these are the components you are being graded on. For more details on each of these sections and their role in a scientific paper, see the Scientific Literature Lab. 9.1.3.1 Title, Authors and Affiliations Your poster should include: (1) a title for your work, (2) authors who contributed to the work and (3) author affiliations. Since you completed this work as a team of scientists, all of your team members are considered authors. List your team members in alphabetical order. The author’s affiliation is the university, college, research institution or company that the work was conducted at. For us, the affiliation would be “Department of Biology, Clovis Community College, California, United States.” 9.1.3.2 Abstract An abstract is a concise summary of your paper. An effective abstract will inform the reader of the scientific hypothesis being tested, the purpose, or “why”, of the study, the main methods, important results and conclusions in only one paragraph. When writing an abstract for a publication or presentation, there is always a maximum word or character count. For your poster, your abstract can have a maximum length of 200 words. Many scientists choose to write the abstract last. Different fields of science have slightly different requirements and formats for abstracts. Here is a general guideline: Background: In one sentence, introduce your work. An effective introduction tells the reader what is known in the field (context) and identifies the gap of knowledge being addressed in the paper. Methods and Results: This section should be the longest part of your abstract, but no more than two or three sentences. This section is arguably the most important part of the abstract, because other scientists seek out a paper when they are interested in the results. The details for your methods will be contained in your paper, so in your abstract you can keep it brief. For your results, pick out the most important results and summarize them. Depending on your research, you may want to address the methods and results separately, but often they are intertwined (e.g. the example abstract below). Conclusions: In one sentence, concisely state what you learned from your research. 9.1.3.3 Introduction A good introduction section should do two things. First, it provides context for your work by describing what is already known in the field, as well as an unknown that your research is addressing. The latter is often called the gap in knowledge. Second, it should identify your scientific question and hypothesis. Usually, the introduction starts broadly, describing the work of other scientists. It is important to summarize this work (do not quote) and to properly cite the work. When writing your introduction, it is often helpful to start at the end. Identify your scientific question, your hypothesis and the gap of knowledge first. Then brainstorm what you will need to tell your readers in terms of context and background. For this project, be sure to include background information on Drosophila melanogaster and why it is a good model system for this research, because your audience might not know. 9.1.3.4 Materials and Methods For your lab poster, your materials and methods section will detail your analysis of the data. Since this is a poster and not an article, you do not need to worry about including all the details and can keep it pretty brief. Don’t provide any of your results, just the methods. Because we did not make the RNA-seq libraries ourselves, you will simply cite the paper that made them instead of detailing their construction. Scientists usually write this section of their paper first, followed by the results section. Some other things you might include would be what type of analysis you decided to do (type of plot, which parts of the midgut you analyzed, sets of genes, what p-value you used, etc.). 9.1.3.5 Results The Results section is where you will detail your data in the form of figures, tables and written text. Begin by creating your tables and figures. Place the figures and tables in order of how you want to present them and name them Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1, Table 2, etc. In your written narrative of the results, you should go through each figure in order, emphasizing any important results from each one. As you discuss each figure, you will reference the figure or table in parentheses. For example: “RT-PCR analysis shows an increase in gene expression for gene X (Fig 2).” It is important that you present your data clearly and in a logical manner. Have fun playing around with how to organize your figures with the text to make the poster look professional. You need a minimum of 2 figures for your poster. 9.1.3.6 Discussion The discussion section of the paper is your chance to analyze and interpret your results. For your lab report, make sure your discussion section includes all of the following: What do your results mean? How do they fit into the bigger picture? If any experiments did not give expected results, hypothesize why that might have been the case and propose alternate experiments that could confirm or clarify your results. Include at least one sentence of future work that you would do if you had more time or what students in upcoming semesters could do to continue to answer your questions. 9.1.3.7 References All the references that you cite on your poster must be present in a References section. For your lab report, make your reference section in alphabetical order by the first author’s last name. For your lab report, all of your sources will be scientific journals and should use the following format: Authors (year) “Title.” Journal Name, vol. #, page #s, DOI Online article that is also in print: Haussecker D., Huang Y., Lau A., Parameswaran P., Fire A. Z. and M. A. Kay (2010) “Human tRNA-derived small RNAs in the global regulation of RNA silencing.” RNA, Vol. 16, page 637-695, doi:10.1261/rna.2000810 Online article only: Marianes, A. and A. C. Spradling (2013) “Physiological and stem cell compartmentalization within the Drosophila midgut.” eLife, doi:10.7554/eLife.00886 9.1.3.8 In-text Citations To save space on our posters, we will number our references 1 through 5 and use the numbers as citations throughout the text of your poster. 9.1.4 Part 3 - Proofread and Add Final Touches Estimated time: 30 min to an hour Each group member should re-read the poster from beginning to end and fix any typos or grammatical errors. Check the alignment of figures, text boxes, titles, etc. Add some finishing touches. You can play with the color, the font, add additional images if it’s relevant. 9.1.5 Part 4 - Canvas Discussion Estimated time: 30 min You will turn in your poster to be graded as a group in a Canvas Assignment and post it to a Canvas Discussion to be viewed by the class. Convert your poster to a pdf. Have one member of your group turn in the pdf of your poster to the Graded Canvas Assignment. This assignment is already set up so that if one group member turns it in, it will show as submitted for all students in the group. This is where your instructor will grade you poster as a group. Have one member of your group post a pdf of your poster in the Canvas C-MOOR Poster Discussion. With your poster, introduce your group members and copy and paste your abstract into the post. Insert your pdf into the post and edit the link so that it automatically shows the inline preview. This will make it easier for students to view your poster. As an individual, read through the other posters from different groups. Post comments 9.1.6 Grading Criteria Everyone in the group earns the same grade, so it is important to work together.
