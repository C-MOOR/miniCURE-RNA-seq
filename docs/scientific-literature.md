## Lab Activity: Scientific Literature

### Instructions

Follow your instructor’s instructions  and answer the following questions with your group. In your responses, properly paraphrase (do not copy/paste or inappropriately paraphrase).  To receive credit, you must use your own words and sentence structure.  Using the same sentence structure (and changing a few words only) is considered plagiarism.
