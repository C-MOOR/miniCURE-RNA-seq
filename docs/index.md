# About this Course {-}

This miniCURE allows students to develop a project using RNA-seq datasets to introduce how model organisms, high-throughput sequencing, and the scientific process are used in both basic and clinical research.

### Learning Goals {-}

- **Navigate biological databases** to access the wealth of available scientific knowledge and data.
- **Analyze data (i.e. create and interpret plots)** to generate novel conclusions.
- **Cultivate an “-omics” perspective**, integrating multiple sources of information and wielding computational tools to enable a holistic approach
- **Practice the scientific process**, identifying avenues for research, designing experiments, analyzing data, and integrating results into the broader scientific discourse.
